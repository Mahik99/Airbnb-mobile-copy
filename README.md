# Airbnb Mobile Site Clone üåç

## Description üì≤:

This project is a mobile version clone of Airbnb‚Äôs website, developed as part of my School of Code pre-course task. The goal of this task was to learn and out into practice my HTML and CSS skills through replicating real-world websites. This clone focuses on the mobile experience, ensuring that the layout and design adapt perfectly to smaller screens.

## Technologies Used:

HTML: Used to structure the content and elements of the page.
CSS: Implemented to style the site and make it look similiar to the original Airbnb website, ensuring that it fits well on mobile devices and that all elements align and scale properly.
